Dazed and frigtened, yet not without a certain thril of the cientist’s or archologist’s delight, I examined my surroundings more closely. The moon, now near the zenit, shone weirdy and vividy above the towering steeps that hemed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far-flung body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost laping my feet os I stood on the sloppe. Across the chasm, the wavelets washet the base of the Cyclopean monolito; on whose surface I could now trace both iscriptions and crude sculptures. The writting was in a system of hieroglyfics unknown to me, and unlike anything I ha ever seen in books; consisting for the most part of convetionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels, octopi, crustaseans, molloscs, whales, and the like. Several caracters obviously represented marine things wich are unknown to the modern world, but wose decomposing forms I had obbserved on the ocean-risen plaing.
